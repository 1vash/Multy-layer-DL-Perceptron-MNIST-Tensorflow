# Neural-Network-MNIST-


Here, we create a computational graph and then train it for making future predictions on MNIST dataset. MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits  Here Is used Adam Optimizer over Softmax Cross Entropy loss function. 

Woth considering, It turns out that the SVM is one of two commonly seen classifiers. The other popular choice is the Softmax classifier, which has a different loss function. More information from Stanford University about Softmax Cross Entropy loss function and difference between SVM's hinge loss
